# Snowhacks_CodeCrafters — Marketing Attribution & ROI Analytics Platform

## 🏆 Hackathon Project
**Team Name:** CodeCrafters  

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Small and medium businesses spend money across multiple marketing channels (Google Ads, Instagram, Email, etc.), but they do not have clear visibility into **which channels actually convert customers**.

This results in:
- High Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Poor budget allocation
- Low Return on Investment (ROI)
- Decisions made on guesswork instead of data

---

## 💡 Our Solution — Web-Based ROI & Channel Performance Dashboard

We are building a simple, practical platform that allows businesses to:
- Enter/upload marketing campaign data
- Calculate **CAC, ROI, Conversion Rate**
- Compare performance across channels
- Identify **best vs under-performing channels**
- Get **actionable recommendations** for budget optimization

Our system is easier and more insightful than manual Excel reporting.
